# Alexi-Bode-Porfolio

In the future I will be posting my tech projects onto this website.

My programming skills have come a long way since I wrote my first lines of code at MNSU in the fall of 2019.

As I continue to learn more code, I hope to start creating programs that are helpful, insightful, appliciable and even very specialized.
