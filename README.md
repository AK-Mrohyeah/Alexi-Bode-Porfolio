# Alexi-Bode-Porfolio

My focus is always shifting from studying to urban communities (my major) to computer science (my minor), and not only in my classes at MNSU but as well as in my freetime. 
Not specializing in one thing could be a mistake but I enjoy learning too much with my unique method of always using one subject to improve my skills in the other.
Studing Urban Studies has taught me a lot about how citys operate policies and services, and coordinate with state and federal officials. 
Studying computer programming has taugh me a lot about the ability to utilize a computer to be a very advance tool.
This website will be where I will share code that I write or come across and see that it pushes limits. 
My programming skills have come a long way since I wrote my first lines of code at MNSU in the fall of 2019.
As I continue to learn more code, I hope to start creating programs that are helpful, insightful, appliciable and even very specialized.
