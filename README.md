# Alexi-Bode-Porfolio

My focus is always shifting from computer science (my minor), to our urban environment (my major) not only with my classes, but in my freetime when I get indulge . 

In the future I will be posting my tech projects onto this website.

My programming skills have come a long way since I wrote my first lines of code at MNSU in the fall of 2019.

As I continue to learn more code, I hope to start creating programs that are helpful, insightful, appliciable and even very specialized.
