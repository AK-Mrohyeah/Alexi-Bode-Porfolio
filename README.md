My focus is always shifting from studying urban communities (my major in college) to computer science (my minor). 
This focus facilitated during my regular class schedule at MNSU and poured over into my freetime. 
Not specializing in one thing could be a mistake but I enjoy learning too much with my unique method of always using one subject to improve my skills in the other.
Studying Urban Studies has taught me a lot about how citys operate with policies, provide services, and coordinate with state and federal officials to provide analysis, and abide by the regulations set uppon them.  
Studying computer programming has taugh me a lot about potential of utilizing a computer for the advance tool it is us.
This website will be where I will share code that I write or come across and see that it pushes limits. 
My programming skills have come a long way since I wrote my first line of code at MNSU in the fall of 2019.
As I continue to learn more programming, I hope to start creating programs that are helpful, insightful, appliciable and even specialized.

My first attempt of pushing the abilities of computer programs and trying to share my findings was at the American Planning Associtioan Chapter Minnesota meeting that held a competition for college students to present a project and win $100. 
My professor gave us an assignment where we were assigned a city and given the assignment of answering all the questions according to your citys code. 
I used an dynamic nueral network algorithm created by this computer scientists that let you copy and paste text into a text box and let you ask a question that, when alligned with the topic of that text, get it right almost every time. 
It took me over 5 hours of googling to find this website: https://demo.deeppavlov.ai/#/en/textqa and I did take the time to find it becuase I knew it existed. 
The algorithm on this website is unbelievably capable of doing a good job.
